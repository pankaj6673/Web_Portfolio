# My Web portfolio using the react 
Here the website is built using React Native and Tailwind CSS. Tailwind is something new for me as I was used to using simple CSS it and importing it to my html file. However, in this case I could style the element on the same file without going back to specific css file.

### `npm start dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
